This is a very simple script that pulls data from the Twitter and Klout APIs to save cutting and pasting manually. Supplied with a list of row separated twitter handles (with or without) the '@' the output is a CSV file witht he relevant columns created.

Authentication is very basic and requires Twitter and Klout credentials to be manually obtained and stored in a json file (params.json) loaded from the same location as the script. There is a sample of this file in the repository, edit and rename it.

Credentials are obtained by following the instructions here:
